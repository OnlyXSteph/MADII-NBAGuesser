# MADII-NBAGuesser

Our Swift iOS app is very similar to the "GuessTheFlag" app we created earlier this semseter. 
Instead of countries, we are guessing famous NBA players. We've implemented a start screen
that uses an animation. To start the game, the user simply needs to click on the play button.
The game screen itself uses some of the same design qualities from the project we mentioned 
above.The user is prompted with a question asking for a certain player. The user then selects
their answer from the pictures of players below. The user's score is incremented and decreased
based off their answers, and is alerted after they answer each question.
